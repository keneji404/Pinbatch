# Pinbatch
A pinterest batch downloader web extension for firefox.

> I made this small project to help me batch download some of the art references I saved in Pinterest since the extensions I found are not available on Firefox or locked behind a paywall, although not perfect, it's get the job done pretty well.

### Features

- Download all pins from a board.
- Automatically fetches the highest quality of an image.

### Things to Improve

- As of now you have to manually load the page completely to fetch all pins.
- No file archiving options such as .rar or .zip.
- You have to manually add the extension through Firefox addon debug mode.
